# Star Wars Random Quote Machine

A random quote generator that generates a new random Star Wars quote every time the page is reloaded or the "Show me a new quote" button is clicked.

A quote can also be tweeted by clicking on the "Tweet this quote" button.

This is an assignment for the freeCodeCamp front end developer certificate.

A couple of days ago, freeCodeCamp switched to the new curriculum which means I'm going to update this project shortly to match the updated requirements.
